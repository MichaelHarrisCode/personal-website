	"about": [
		"Emulator for 8080 processor made in C. Still a work in progress.",
		"Currently, it's capable of disassembling a program written in 8080 assembly. It'll take a stream of 8bit numbers, then perform operations based on the given opcode.",
		"I wanted to make this because I believe it will help strengthen my C abilities, while also being able to build a project to show. The added benefit is the ability to play games built for the 8080 processor. Additionally, I feel like it also teaches me more about how CPU's work, through application. However, I feel like the biggest benefit is that this will build up knowledge needed for operating system development."
